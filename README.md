# my_dnn
my own implementation of a neural network

This attempts to be a learning resource for myself in order to grasp the basics of forward propagation 
and backward propagation in deep neural networks. I introduce the following topics:

- deep neural network architecture,
- forward propagation,
- cross-entropy cost function,
- backward propagation.

The emphasis lies in identifying three types of matrix operations:

- matrix multiplication (.)
- element-wise multiplication (*)
- broadcasting operations (formulated through matrices of a given size with the same value in each entry).

A very basic implementation inspired by Andrew Ng's course Deep Learning is given in nn.py and the explanatory
notes appear in nn.pdf.
